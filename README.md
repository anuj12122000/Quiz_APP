The main of the project was to learn and implement react hooks and contexts. 

Mainly I have made 3 components that are quiz, menu and endscreen and made a sperate js file and putted some
questions into it .

We can also restart the quiz after playing it once.
On the menu component when we click the start Quiz button the state of the app changes to quiz

That's when quiz component came into action then one by one Iterating through those questions .

And at the end screen User's total score was displayed along with a button to restart the quiz.

It was really fun to make this project.# Quiz_APP
